# French-MPTL

This project evaluates the performance of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Logit-weighted Reduced Mixture of Experts (LRMoE) in general insurance modelling via an open French Motor Third-Party Liability dataset.

## Currently existing:

* Added fitted GLMs and GAMs with corresponding R Markdown.
* Added fitted LRMoEs with corresponding R Markdown and init analysis.
* Added fitted Hurdle Poisson LRMoEs.
* Revised R Markdowns to accommodate the updated package. Previous versions are stored in folder "Deprecated" for reference.

## Updated Aug 13, 2020

* Added simulations for aggregate claim amount, using "llblll" LRMoE, Tweedie GAM and zero-inflated Gamma GAM.
